        <h2 id="what">What is <span class="scTextColor">Cadent</span> and how would it help me work?</h2>
        <p>
            I am tired of productivity apps being so convoluted and doing so many things at once. 
            I feel like I spend more time trying to do productivity “right”, that I actually become less productive. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't want to make a new task title, description, due date, assign it to someone, constantly update the status, etc. 
            Do I make a new task or update this one? What category do I assign it?
        </p>
        <p>
            It's so much work that isn't the ACTUAL work that I just don't do it. But then, I get disorganized.
        </p>
        <p>
            So <span class="scTextColor">Cadent</span> solves all of that. 
        </p>
        <p>
            How it works: 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>You press the microphone</li>
            <li>You say, “I just finished my PowerPoint slides for my boss. I think I'm gonna finish the minutes from the last meeting and send it out”</li>
            <li>Cadent completes old tasks, makes new tasks, prioritizes them as needed, and presents them to you to complete.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            It's just you thinking out loud, and then your tasks get organized for you.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h2 id="what">I'm not gonna remember to do this.</h2>
        <p>
            And you don't have to. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Turn on a work session and <span class="scTextColor">Cadent</span> will ask you for regular updates. 
            It's just quick 5-second updates throughout your day and you stay on track.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even better, it will learn how you work. 
            As you tell it which tasks you complete, it can see how well you work on different types of tasks, 
            at what times of day, and how you prioritize things.
        </p>
        <p>
            It will not only keep you on track, but it will also <strong>schedule your work better</strong> too.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h2 id="what">I'm still confused.</h2>
        <p>
            Do you see how “productivity apps” have messed you up? 
            You're expecting a bunch of features when all you need to do is your voice tell the app what you did, 
            and what you need to do, for it to organize your tasks for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just download the app and try it. 
            You get full access for 7 days, completely free. 
            If it doesn’t work for you, just cancel your trial.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before you leave though, please send me a message to let me know why it didn’t work for you. 
            I want to make something useful.
        </p>
